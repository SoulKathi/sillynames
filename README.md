### What is it? ###

This is a little demo of how to testing with Selenium
(https://www.seleniumhq.org/). The app presents names which are presumed to be
funny.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Install PhantomJS. Get it from the PhantomJS homepage, http://phantomjs.org/,
  install it and add it to your path.

* Set up the Virtualenv with `make venv`.
* Activate it with `source venv/bin/activate`
* Install needed packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the tests with `make test`

### Docker issues ###

This also contains a Dockerfile. With this, you can create a Docker image, run
it and access the app from your host. But the Docker setup can not run the
tests, there is a problem with PhantomJS that prevents this. Although it looks
like you can install PhantomJS with Node/Npm, I couldn't set it up so the tests
could be run.
